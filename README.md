# Guess Number Game
This program is a Number Guessing Game that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the player to guess the number.

## How to Play
Upon running the program, the user is prompted to choose a difficulty level. The player can choose between 'easy' and 'hard', with 'easy' giving 10 attempts to guess the number and 'hard' giving 5 attempts. Once the difficulty level is selected, the game starts and the player is prompted to make a guess.

After each guess, the program will let the player know if their guess was too high or too low, and how many attempts they have left. If the player runs out of attempts, they lose the game. If the player guesses the number correctly, they win the game.
